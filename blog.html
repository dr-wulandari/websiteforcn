    <h4>Going Full Andrew</h4>
    <p>14 May 2021 <br>
    You think your children know everything about you. The you at your best while arguing with their Headmaster, and the you at your worst, when your head is down a kitchen sink retching the night away. At least I thought so... Afterall, my children are renowned for taking unflattering pictures of me while I am asleep. Mouth gaping, eyeballs rolled back, and throat making that choking sound. At somepoint in my life, I could not visit the toilet without having two little things following me there. No long shower, no solitary dental visits, no quiet coffee. They are always there. Constantly watching me live my incompetent life. There is nothing they have yet seen. Or so I thought... <br><br> 
    Until one day, a coding course at Code Nation brought a project task that had to be done as a team. Nothing ground breaking, though I quickly shoved a team-mate named Andrew to take up the PM seat (a la bitchy Apprentice contestant). He kindly obliged. Team tasks were moving along, though not as fast as they could've been. I admit to putting off some duties assigned to me by PM Andrew, because I didn't feel like it, or because I thought I could do it later. <br><br>
    Then that fateful Thursday happened. It was voting day, and my daughter was off school because her school was being used as a polling station. So she sat there in front of me at the kitchen island as I was having my zoom meeting with my team-mates: PM Andrew, and a fellow straggler Paul.
    Like a good PM falling behind schedule, Andrew gave us a full telling off, an earful, no, two ears overful. Andrew delivered his disappointment at his team-mates like flying daggers. Emphasizing what we should have done, but we had not done. I took it with grace in silence. I knew it was not personal, and honestly, this kind of dressing down coming from a boss is nothing new. All too common in the world of corporations. So I apologised to Andrew and made a promise that I would get all my tasks done by the end of the day (which I did). <br><br>
    I didn't realise that for my daughter, who saw everything unfolded in person, it was trully an alien sight. Something unthinkable. All her life, I had always been the ultimate figure of authority. No one can tell mummy off, not even the Mayor of Manchester. So when Paul, Andrew, and I finished the zoom call, my daughter sighed, "whoa..." <br><br>
    "What?" I asked my daughter. She didn't reply, just looked at me funny and she moved on with her school work. <br><br>
    Later that night, for one reason and another, I lost it with my kids. Gave them some serious telling off, I went beserk throwing their dirty clothes down the stairs. For Goodness sake, a 13 yo and a 10 yo are old enough to sort through their own clothing, right?<br><br>
    At bed time, I sat on the edge of my daughter's bed, undoing her braids. That's when she said it... <br><br>
    "Mummy, you were going full Andrew for a minute there." <br>
    "What?" I was bemused. <br>
    "Going full Andrew." She repeated herself. <br>
    That was when it dawned on me that she had never seen me being told off by anyone. That what Andrew did earlier as PM was seen as the ultimate wrath. A wrath, worthy of mummy's concession. The highest level of wrath. At sorcery level, in the realm of magical creatures, lives Andrew the mummy-slayer. <br><br>
    It doesn't stop there though. The term "going full Andrew" is now a real thing in our household. Just the other day, apparently my son went full Andrew at his swim-team. <br><br>
    If nothing else comes out of this coding course, it has at least left a lasting legacy in our household. In the form of "Going Full Andrew." and another side of me that my children had never seen before.<br><br>
    Andrew, thank you.
