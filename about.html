    <h3>A little about me...</h3>
    <p>A woman who is - dare I say - almost 40 years old. I have two kids (13 & 10) and I originally came from Indonesia. I have been in UK for a while though, I have worked and studied here (in that order). <br> My industry was telecommunication, into which I begrudgingly tripped and fell (around 15 years ago). Due to various reasons (IR35, Brexit, and the Covid-19 Pandemic) I found myself redundant, and with this drastic change I resolved to get myself out of the telecommunication industry. <br> My situation was peculiar, I was not entitled to any help from the UK government because I had been earning well enough and I paid taxes and NI and I had some savings. I went into a Job Centre, and the Manchester City Hall, asking for help as I couldn't afford my £1000 pcm house-rent and I was on the brink of eviction. Their answers were the same: I have to live on my savings until it's all gone and that I am (and my children are) homeless. <br> It all felt very unfair at the time... if I had never bothered to work, I could probably get government help fairly easily (even housing). But because I did, they wouldn't help until I find myself (and my children) in an actual ditch. <br><br> One day, on a financial-forum on the internet, an Independent Financial Advisor made a passing comment, "Just spend all your money then go back to Job Centre." <br> So I did. I spent everything I had to buy a small terrace house. I took a small mortgage to top it up. Now my mortgage is about £365 pcm which is a lot less than the previous £1000 pcm for a roof over our heads. I had some breathing space. <br> Armed with zero savings and a newly purchased home, I went back to the Job Centre, and this time around, they processed my application for help. Apparently I am entitled to some £1300 per month, but after various (and mysterious) deductions, Universal Credit commited to give me £250. Yay! Better than nothing. I am grateful.<br><br>It was literally on the first day ever of my UC payment that someone directed me to a coding course with Code Nation. That..., brought us here, on this silly website I made myself using only HTML and CSS. I have made websites in the past, but I used Dreamweaver, this time around, I know better. Who would've thought that? At this age, I can still be better. </p>
    <h3>Some other trivia about me...</h3>>
    <ul>
        <li>I was diagnosed with Autism as a child, all those decades ago ~ before Autism was cool.</li>
        <li>At age 14 I spent a night at a mental institution in a straitjacket for biting a psychiatric nurse's hand.</li>
        <li>I am also dyslexic.</li>
        <li>I have moved house 17 times in the last 15 years, all around the world. In fact since I was born, I never lived in the same house/area for more than 3 years. Because of this, I don't have a home-town. I am a true lost soul.</li>
        <li>English is my 4th language, and Spanish is my 5th.</li>
        <li>In 2019, my head was completely bald.</li>
        <li>I am naturally left-handed, but I was brought up to be right-handed (to fit into acceptable  social norm).</li>
        <li>I have sensory problems. My screen brightness setting is always at it's lowest, and I sometimes wear sunglasses at home, and I watch TV on mute with subtitles on.</li>
        <li>I often feel that I am the oldest where ever I go. The world gets younger and younger, only I age alone.</li>
    </ul>
